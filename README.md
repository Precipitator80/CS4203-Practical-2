# CS4203 Practical 2: The Discussion Forum

The specification outlined the creation of a secure discussion system that maximises the confidentiality and privacy of the participants. The final implementation offers a secure platform for users to chat and discuss, with data stored anonymously with zero-knowledge on a database. The report outlines the application's features, giving details on the architecture used. Several key topics were identified, covering areas of data safety, key management and user anonymity. Furthermore, a threat model on these key concerns is presented, showing how the system addresses these and suggesting steps that could be taken in future to strengthen the system further.
